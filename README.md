# Fitness Grapher

## Purpose
This app will allow the user to access his or her google spreadsheet and graph data.
You must be wondering why this app is necessary since spreadsheets can also graph data.
Spreadsheets can only graph data if there is one attribute per cell.

| Date | Workout |
|------|---------|
|date1 | data1   |


However, if there are multiple attributes per cell, and the user needs to create a graph
that involves only 1 attribute, that is not possible using spreadsheets.

| Date | Workout |
|------|---------|
|date1 | data1, data2,...   |

This app aims to fix that.


## Usage
